If last row is empty, adding a person inflates it

~~Make bubble's borderColor match sun/moon color?~~ it's ugly

Make bouncing animation (or any other pending state animation) instead of the activity monitor

~~Pending doesn't need to be an array, it can be a boolean...~~

## Urgent

If tapping a row, then the row below it:
initially they both load;
when the first settles, it shows completed and the second disappears;
when the second settles, it shows completed and the first loads forever.
